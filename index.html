<h3>5th Edition</h3>

<p>

Yahoo, Microsoft, Google, and other 4th edition dissenters formed their own subcommittee to design a less ambitious update of ECMAScript 3, tentatively named ECMAScript 3.1. This edition would focus on security and library updates with a large emphasis on compatibility. After the aforementioned public sparring, the ECMAScript 3.1 and ECMAScript 4 teams agreed on a compromise: the two editions would be worked on, in parallel, with coordination between the teams to ensure that ECMAScript 3.1 remains a strict subset of ECMAScript 4 in both semantics and syntax.

</p>
<p>

However, the differing philosophies in each team resulted in repeated breakages of the subset rule, and it remained doubtful that the ECMAScript 4 dissenters would ever support or implement ECMAScript 4 in the future. After over a year since the disagreement over the future of ECMAScript within the Ecma Technical Committee 39, the two teams reached a new compromise in July 2008: Brendan Eich announced that Ecma TC39 would focus work on the ECMAScript 3.1 (later renamed to ECMAScript, 5th Edition) project with full collaboration of all parties, and vendors would target at least two interoperable implementations by early 2009.[25][26] In April 2009, Ecma TC39 published the "final" draft of the 5th edition and announced that testing of interoperable implementations was expected to be completed by mid-July.[27] On December 3, 2009, ECMA-262 5th edition was published.[28]

<h3>6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015</h3>
<p>

The 6th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2015, was finalized in June 2015.[11][29][9] This update adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, but defines them semantically in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. Other new features include iterators and for/of loops, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions, binary data, typed arrays, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), promises, number and math enhancements, reflection, and proxies (metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers).[30][31] The complete list is extensive.[32]

<p>

Browser support for ES6 is still incomplete.[33] However, ES6 code can be transpiled into ES5 code, which has more consistent support across browsers. [34] Transpiling adds an extra step to your build process whereas polyfills allow you to add extra functionalities by including another javascript file.

<h3>7th Edition - ECMAScript 2016</h3>
<p>
The 7th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2016, was finalized in June 2016.[12] New features include the exponentiation operator (**) and Array.prototype.includes.
